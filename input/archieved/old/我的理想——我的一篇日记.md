# 我的理想——我的一篇日记

一不小心翻到了以前初中写的一篇日记，为了装X还是用英文写的，羞耻度爆表……

Today we learned how to talk about future intentions. Iwant to be a programmer when I grow up. So how am I going to do it? I’m goingto study computer science and English when I have free time. It’s veryimportant. I learned Visual Basic. It was made by Microsoft. I can make someprogram now. On my last summer vacation, I made some programs, like notepad. Forexample, the program was made for a math problem:

```vb
Private Sub Main()
Const 兔脚数 As Integer = 4, 鸡脚数 As Integer = 2
Dim 总头数 As Long, 总脚数 As Long, 鸡的数量 As Long, 兔的数量 As Long
总头数 =Val(InputBox("从上面看一共有多少个头？"))
总脚数 =Val(InputBox("从下面看一共有多少只脚？"))
If (总头数 < 0) Or (总脚数 < 0) Or (总头数 * 2 > 总脚数) Then
    MsgBox "输入有误！", vbExclamation
    Exit Sub
End If
鸡的数量 = (兔脚数 * 总头数 - 总脚数) / (总脚数 - 鸡脚数)
兔的数量 = 总头数 - 鸡的数量
计算结果 = "鸡有" & 鸡的数量 & "只，兔有" & 兔的数量 & "只。"
Call bcjg
MsgBox 计算结果, vbInformation
End Sub
```

You can see a form on the screen if the program isrunning. Input the number of heads and click the button “OK”. Then you can seeanother form on the screen. You can input the number of feet. Click the button “OK”again. Finally, you can see the result.

I sent my programs to my friends by e-mail.

I want to make a company. I call it WonderfulSoft. Iknow it’s very difficult. But I hope one day my dream can be true.

My IT teacher said: “Java is more useful than VisualBasic. Because the program was made by it can run on the many systems.” I alsowant to learn it. But it is too difficult to learn. I think I’ll learn to makeprograms by Java.
